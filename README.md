# sociable
We are excited to introduce Sociable! A platform that connects university students through their shared challenges. We’re doing this in 2 ways:   


Events: We show you what’s going on in your school and local community. We aim to make local events accessible and known to students, and we’re starting with Halifax, NS.


Chats: We are advocates for strong mental health, so our app will include an opportunity to chat with other students facing similar challenges to you. Our goal is to open and de-stigmatize the conversation surrounding students’ mental health by providing a safe space and support for all. 


We’re thrilled to share Sociable with you: an app that gives you the opportunity to connect, meet, and support inspiring students like yourself.
